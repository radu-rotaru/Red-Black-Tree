# Red-Black-Tree
Implementation of Red-Black Tree structure and some operations that can be applied to it.

Multime class represents the entire structure of a Red-Black Tree, while the Node class represents a single node in the structure.
In main.cpp I've used the chrono library to count the performance of the data structure on multiple inputs.
